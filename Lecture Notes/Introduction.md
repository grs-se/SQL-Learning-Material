### What is Postgres?
* Databases used to store information, take data from some source put it inside db where it gets persisted in either memory or on hard-disk, and eventually we retrieve that data.
* Retrieve data using a client, connect to db using client: a piece of software, an api, or server, a utility programme, or Wide variety of different clients.
* When we connect a client to the db we are going to write some SQL, sql is a programming language of sorts, it tells our db some info that we want to put inside of it, retrieve, update or delete. 
* SQL is very different / separate to postgres itself, sql is a communciation language, it is how we interface or interact with our db. SQL is supported by many other databases as well such as oracle, mssql, mysql, - generally all the same, not 100% but in general.
